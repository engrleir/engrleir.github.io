      <p>
        When doing construction work, one of the tasks is to cut rebars into required lengths. For example, if we need
        two bars of length 3.5 meters and 2 meters, we could get one 6-meter long bar and cut it into the required
        lengths - with the remaining 0.5 meter considered as wastage.
      </p>

      <p>For small projects, the wastages are insignificant to the cost of the project. But for larger projects
        involving hundreds or even thousands of required cuttings, the wastages can easily pile.</p>

      <p>This document will discuss how to minimize the wastages and optimize the cutting patterns given a length of
        available rebar.</p>

      <p>We will try to answer the following problem: The required lengths of rebars for a construction project are
        shown below:</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Required Length</th>
          <th>Number of Pieces</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4.5 m</td>
          <td>97 pcs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3.4 m</td>
          <td>610 pcs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2.5 m</td>
          <td>395 pcs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2.3 m</td>
          <td>211 pcs</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>If the available length of a rebar is 11.7 meters, what is the minimum amount of rebars that can be used?</p>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="A_Greedy_Algorithm">
      <header>A Greedy Algorithm</header>

      <p>The first solution I thought of can be summarize using the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with one uncut bar.</li>
        <li>Create a sorted list of all the required bar lengths.</li>
        <li>Get the longest required length and cut it from the uncut bar.</li>
        <li>Get the next longest required length and continue cutting it from the uncut bar.</li>
        <li>If no available space is left, get another uncut bar.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process of getting the longest required length.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I later found out that this is also called the <strong>First-Fit Decreasing</strong> bin packing algorithms.
        Here's the python implementation of the algorithm</p>

      <pre><code>
          # A script for optimising the cutting of rebars in to designated lengths

          from collections import Counter


          def FFD(r,L):
          ''' The algorithm cuts the largest size from a bar,
          if there is no space remaining, get another bar.
          The process repeats until all required lengths are placed.
          '''

            # list of remaining length in a single bar
            remaining = [L]

            # list of cuts
            cuttingList = [[]]

            for length in sorted(r, reverse=True):
              for i, free in enumerate(remaining):
                if free >= length:
                  remaining[i] -= length
                  cuttingList[i].append(length)
                  break
              else:
                # this else block runs if the for loop
                # is not terminated by a break, that is, if
                # the remaining length is less than the
                # current required bar length
                cuttingList.append([length])
                remain.append(L-length)

          return cuttingList
        </code></pre>

      <p>
        Calling the function and supplying the necessary data, we get the following answer
      </p>

      <pre><code>
          # Length of a single bar
          L = 11.7

          # Required lengths
          r = [4.5, 3.4, 2.5, 2.3]

          # required quantity for each length
          q = [97, 610, 395, 211]

          # Array containing list of all required bars
          s=[]
          for j in range(len(r)):
            for i in range(q[j]):
              s.append(r[j])

          # Solve the cutting stock problem using First-Fit Decreasing
          solution = FFD(s,L)
          counts = Counter(tuple(x) for x in solution)
          print("Required Lengths:")
          for i in counts:
            print("{} pcs at {} m".format(counts[i],i))

          print("You need {} pcs of {} m bars".format(len(solution), L))

          ''' This will Output:

      <p>As you can see, the algorithm shows as the cutting patters we should do and it's telling us we need 381 pcs of
        11.7 m bars. <strong>But we can do better.</strong></p>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="A_Similar_Kind_of_Problem">
      <header>A Similar Kind of Problem</header>
      <p>When researching the problem in the internet, I stumbled upon a type of problem very similar to this. It is
        called the <strong>Cutting-Stock Problem</strong>. In this problem, paper of different lengths is to be cut from
        rolls of paper with a given length. The goal is to minimized the amount of waste paper.</p>

      <p>Solutions for the Cutting-Stock Problem is still being researched today. The most popular/earliest solution
        involves what we call a column-generation algorithm and using a knapsack algorithm to generate the columns.</p>

      <p>First, let us define how to represent our data.</p>

      <p>Required cutting lengths and the number of pieces for each will be represented by arrays. We will use the
        <code>numpy</code> package for our
        solution</p>
      <pre><code>
        import numpy as np

        # Length of a single bar
        barLength = 11.7

        # Array of required cutting lengths
        lengths = np.array([4.5, 3.4, 3.5, 2.3])

        # Number of pieces corresponding to each required length
        quantities = np.array([97, 610, 395, 211])
      </code></pre>

      <p>We will represent cutting patterns as column vectors containing how many pieces of a given length is present in
        the pattern.</p>

      <pre><code>
        2 1 1 0
        0 1 0 1
        0 0 0 2
        0 0 1 0
      </code></pre>

      <p>The matrix shown has four columns which represents four cutting patterns. The first column <code>2 0 0 0</code>
        represent a pattern where we cut two 4.5 m lengths from the rebar which yields 2.7 m of waste. Remember we are
        using 11.7 m bars for our example. The second column <code>1 1 0 0</code> represents a cut of 4.5 m and 3.4 m
        with a waste of 3.8 m. The other columns follow similarly with one cut of 4.5 m and one cut of 2.3 m for the
        third column and one cut of 3.4 m and two cuts of 2.5 m for the fourth column.</p>

      <p>These are the steps we will follow for this solution:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Generate a basic cutting pattern. This will be based on how many pieces of each cut length can we fit in the
          given rebar length. For our example, we can fit two 4.5 m lengths in one 11.7 m bar, so the first cutting
          pattern is <code>2 0 0 0</code>. The whole matrix of cutting patterns for each cut length is given below:
          <pre><code>
          2 0 0 0
          0 3 0 0
          0 0 4 0
          0 0 0 5
        </code></pre>
          <p>In python this is</p>
          <pre><code>
          # total size of all lumber required
          pieces_total = np.sum(quantities)

          # number of unique pieces which are required
          pieces_types = len(lengths)

          # initialize the patterns A for cutting the stock
          diag = np.floor((barLength)/(lengths).astype(float))
          patterns = np.zeros((pieces_types, pieces_types))
          np.fill_diagonal(patterns, diag)
        </code></pre>
        </li>

        <li>Solve for the required number of bars using the patterns. This can be computed by solving the linear
          equation <code>[patterns][number of bars] = [required quantities]</code>
          <pre><code>
          num_bars = np.linalg.solve(patterns,quantities)
        </code></pre>
        </li>

        <li>
          We begin producing a new pattern using a custom <code>knapsack</code> function that we will show in the next
          section. The function will return a new cutting pattern and some kind of score/criteria that says it is a
          better pattern than what currently exist.

          <pre><code>
             # (sum^m)_i (yi * ai) > 1
             y = np.linalg.solve(patterns.T, np.ones(pieces_types))

             # entering pattern (ep)
             ep, zj = knapsack(lengths, y, barLength, precision)
          </code></pre>

        </li>
        <li>We then replace one of the columns with the new pattern, selecting the column in which it will have the
          greatest effect.

          <pre><code>
            # test if zj > 1
            if(zj>1):
              # find to which column we place the new pattern
              pj = np.linalg.solve(patterns,ep)

              theta = [0]*len(pj)
              for i in range(len(pj)):
                if(pj[i]!=0):
                  theta[i] = num_bars[i]/pj[i]

              new_col = theta.index(min([i for i in theta if i > 0]))

              patterns[:,[new_col]] = np.array([ep]).T
          </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>We then repeat the process from step 2 until we could no longer produce patterns that are better than what
          we have or we have reached the maximum number of iterations.
          <pre>
            <code>
              for _ in range(maxsteps):
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>We output the patterns and the number of bars required for these set of patterns

          <pre><code>
        return patterns,num_bars
      </code></pre>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>We put all of this in a function <code>csp(lengths, quantities, barLength, precision=100., maxsteps=100)</code>
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        def csp(lengths, quantities, barLength=6.0, precision=100., maxsteps=100):

      <p>The new pattern that we will generate should minimize the waste and there should be an attribute where we could
        somehow judge that it is a better pattern. This can be solved as a type of a knapsack problem.</p>

      <p>The knapsack problem can be solved using a dynamic-programming technique. The knapsack problem in context of
        our rebar cutting problem, can be described as fitting in the rebars while minimizing the waste and maximizing
        the <em>value</em>. The value here will be the <em>y</em> values we got from the preceding steps.</p>
