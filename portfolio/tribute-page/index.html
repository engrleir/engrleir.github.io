      <h3>Who is Marie Curie?</h3>
      <p align="justify">
        Marie Sklodowska Curie is a Polish (later became French) physicist and chemist. Considered as the pioneering
        researcher of radioactivity, she is credited with the discovery of the elements polonium and radium.

        <li><b>1867 - Marie Curie was born</b> in Poland on November 7, 1867.</li>
        <li><b>1891 - Marie moved to Paris.</b> She went there to study at Sorbonne.</li>
        <li><b>1895 - Marie gets married.</b> Marie married Peirre Curie, which was when her name became Marie Curie.
        </li>
        <li><b>1897 - Marie becomes a mother.</b> Marie's first born daughter, Irene, is born.</li>
        <li><b>1902 - Marie works with radium.</b> Marie was hired to do some experiments. While working on them, she
          discovered pure radium.</li>
        <li><b>1903 - Marie and her husband win the a Nobel Prize.</b> Marie and her husband, Pierre, were awarded a
          Nobel Prize for their work with radioactivity.</li>
        <li><b>1904 - Marie moves up.</b> Marie was promoted to the chief asistant to her husband in his laboratory.
        </li>
        <li><b>1904 - Pierre becomes a teacher.</b> Pierre began teaching at Sorbonne.</li>
        <li><b>1906 - Marie is widowed.</b> Marie's husband, Pierre, was killed in an accident. She took his place
          teaching at Sorbonne and was the first professor there.</li>
        <li><b>1911 - Another Nobel Prize.</b> Marie won her second Nobel Prize, this time on her own, for her continued
          work in radioactivity.</li>
        <li><b>1914 - The x-ray is used in battle.</b> During WWI, Marie used her radioactive research materials to do
          "x-rays". The x-rays found bullets and other shrapnel in wounded soldiers.</li>
        <li><b>1922 - Marie devotes her life to medicine.</b> Marie became a member of the French Academy of Medicine.
          She devoted herself to using her knowledge to help people.</li>
        <li><b>1929 - Marie Curie visits America.</b> Marie was honored everywhere she went, and was given a gram of
          radium as a gift.</li>
        <li><b>1932 - She joins the fight against cancer.</b> Marie and her sister started a research facility to help
          fight cancer. It is still opened today and is called the Marie Sklodowska Curie Oncology Center.</li>
        <li><b>1934 - Marie Curie dies.</b> Marie got sick and died shortly after, but she will never be forgotten. Her
          work helped advance the medical world and save thousands of lives.</li>

      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify">The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it
          could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced
          a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided
          men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the
          atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In
          medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully
          attacked.</p>
